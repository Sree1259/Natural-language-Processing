# Natural-language-Processing
This repository showcases the application of core Natural Language Processing techniques â€” from sentiment analysis to text generation â€” using real-world examples and data-driven workflows. The project demonstrates the full data science lifecycle, from problem definition to insight generation.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project explores how machines can interpret, categorize, and generate human language through a structured data science approach. It applies NLP techniques across different types of text data â€” such as merchandise reviews, emails, and quotes â€” to derive meaningful insights and generate new text content.

ðŸ§© Techniques Implemented
1. Sentiment Analysis

Example: Merchandise reviews (positive, negative, neutral)

Goal: Understand customer sentiment and satisfaction levels

Tools: TextBlob, NLTK, sklearn

2. Topic Modelling

Example: Email classification into Personal, Project, Promotional, etc.

Goal: Discover hidden themes and organize large collections of text

Tools: Gensim, sklearn, Pandas

3. Text Generation

Example: Generate quotes based on previous text data

Goal: Create new text that mimics the style and context of input data

Tools: NLTK, TextBlob, re, Pandas

## NLP in Python

ðŸ§® Programming & Libraries

Data Handling: Pandas, re

Machine Learning: sklearn

Text Processing: NLTK, TextBlob, Gensim

Visualization: Matplotlib / WordCloud (if used)

ðŸ“Š Math & Statistics Concepts

Document-Term Matrix (DTM) â€“ representing text numerically

Corpus Building â€“ preparing and cleaning text for analysis

Sentiment Scoring â€“ polarity and subjectivity metrics

Topic Modelling (LDA) â€“ latent theme extraction from text

Text Generation Models â€“ sequence prediction and pattern-based generation

## Data Science Workflow

Define Question â€“ What are we trying to learn or predict?

Get and Clean Data â€“ Text collection, tokenization, stopword removal

Explore Data (EDA) â€“ Visualize word frequencies, distributions, correlations

Apply NLP Techniques â€“ Sentiment analysis, topic modelling, text generation

Share Insights â€“ Communicate findings through visualizations and examples

The project is to find answer for 
# "Why is this comedian different from others?"
